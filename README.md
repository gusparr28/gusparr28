### Hello everyone,

I'm a computer engineer with a passion for backend development. I consider myself a persevering and detail-oriented person, both in programming and life. Iâ€™m always learning about new technologies, stacks, frameworks, and languages. I hold a deep affection for clean, scalable and maintainable code and consistently strive to cultivate it in such a manner.

Football and bass guitar as hobbies, and video games, series, and movies as entertainment.
