Greetings to all 😄👋, 

As you can discern, my commit count may not be as prolific. This, however, is not indicative of my inactive status as a programmer. Quite the contrary, I am actively harnessing my programming acumen to compose code for corporate projects 💼👨‍💼. These projects are hosted on platforms such as GitLab and BitBucket, serving as conduits to house their endeavors and reap financial gains. From these gains, I receive a minute (indeed, a truly diminutive, supremely minute, ultra-small) percentage, which aids in my sustenance.

Now that you understand the rationale behind the seemingly darker shade of my commit panel – akin to the mustache of Steve Harvey  – allow me to introduce myself: I am Gustavo Parra 🚀, a computer engineer with an ardor for backend application development. While I do not lay claim to the title of the world's preeminent programmer, nor do I acknowledge myself as the least proficient, I do consider myself steadfast and exacting in my programming pursuits 📌🧑‍💻, as well as in life in general. I am an individual in a perpetual state of education concerning novel technologies, stacks, frameworks, and languages. I hold an affection for clean, maintainable code, and I diligently labor to perpetuate these attributes throughout my work.

Football, hamburgers, and animals hold my affections ⚽️🍔🐶. I aspire to become a music producer someday 🎧.

I adhere to a life motto 📝 (and with this, I bid adieu), which is,

***"I would err a thousand times more if that were the cost of acquiring ten thousand new learnings."***

Indeed, mistakes have guided me to become the individual I am today.

Thank you for reading.

Best regards,
Gustavo Parra 🤘.
