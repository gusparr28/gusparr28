### Hello everyone!

So, you might notice that my commit count isn't through the roof. But don't worry, that doesn’t mean I’m not coding. In fact, I’m busy writing code for corporate projects. These projects live on platforms like GitLab and BitBucket, where companies do their thing and make money. I get a tiny (and I mean really tiny) piece of that pie, which helps me get by.

Now that you know why my commit graph might look as dark as Steve Harvey’s mustache, let me introduce myself:

I’m Gustavo Parra, a computer engineer who’s passionate about backend development. I consider myself a persistent and detail-oriented person, both in programming and in life in general. I’m always learning about new technologies, stacks, frameworks, and languages. I hold a deep affection for clean, scalable and maintainable code and consistently strive to cultivate it in such a manner.

Football and bass guitar as hobbies, and video games, series, and movies as entertainment.

If you made it this far, thanks for reading!

Best regards.
