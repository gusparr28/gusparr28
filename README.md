### Hello everyone,

I’m Gustavo Parra, a computer engineer who’s passionate about backend development. I consider myself a persistent and detail-oriented person, both in programming and in life in general. I’m always learning about new technologies, stacks, frameworks, and languages. I hold a deep affection for clean, scalable and maintainable code and consistently strive to cultivate it in such a manner.

Football and bass guitar as hobbies, and video games, series, and movies as entertainment.

Best regards.

**P.S. I used ChatGPT 3.5 to translate this from Spanish.**
